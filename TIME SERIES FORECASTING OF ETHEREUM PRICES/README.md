# Time Series Forecasting of Ethereum Prices

This repository is for our project on forecasting Ethereum cryptocurrency prices using the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method. Our goal was to build a model that can predict short-term price trends based on historical data. We used statistical tools and software to handle and analyze the data properly.

## Software Requirements

R and RStudio: All the coding and testing are done using R.


## Project Summary

In recent years, the increasing interest in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, which are known for their quick and large price changes, presents both opportunities and difficulties for investors and market analysts. Ethereum is particularly known for its unpredictable prices, making it a challenge to forecast its future movements. Our project focuses on the task of forecasting Ethereum prices using time series analysis.

To tackle this, we use a statistical method called Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, suited for data with trends and seasonal changes. The process started with preparing and cleaning the data to ensure no information was missing and no errors were present. Using tools like R and RStudio, we analyzed Ethereum's price movements, examining trends and how prices have changed over time to develop a model that predicts short-term price changes. However, due to the unpredictable nature of Ethereum, long-term predictions remain challenging.

Our study didn't stop at model development. We conducted various statistical tests, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, to ensure our model was accurate and could handle future data. These efforts aim to provide a reliable forecasting tool that offers insights into Ethereum's future price direction, helping both everyday traders and serious investors make better financial decisions.

Despite the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies, we believe our model provides valuable insights into Ethereum's price trends and can be a useful tool for understanding market dynamics.
